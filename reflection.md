# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
The UML design is feed dog, walk dog, give medicine, groom cat, play fetch. The Owner stores user information and preferences. Each Pet stores its own care tasks. The Task class represents activities such as feeding or walking, including duration and priority. Finally, the Scheduler generates a daily plan based on available time and task priority. Separating these responsibilities makes the application easier to maintain and extend.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?
The classes that I included into the design are Owner, Pet, Task and Schedule. The responsiblities that I assigned to each is: for Owner name, available time, preference, pets; for Pet name, species, age, tasks; for Task title, duration, priority, completed; for Schedule tasks. 

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
Yes
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.
One change that I made was Scheduler needs more context and so Scheduler now stores an Owner instead of only a task list

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
